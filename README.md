#UdacityPythonProjects

This repositorium shows my basic python skills that are represented by two projects that were mede for **[Udacity program](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-programming-nanodegree--nd000)**

First project retrieves locations and data about the weather from this locations from **[metaweather site](https://www.metaweather.com)**.

Second is a simple adventure game, where I got the scenario of the game and I had to implement the logic.
